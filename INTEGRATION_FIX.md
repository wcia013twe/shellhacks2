# Eye Tracker Integration Fix

## 🐛 **Problem Identified**

The error "test integration not available" was occurring because:

1. **Incorrect Import Paths**: The code was trying to import `from eye_tracking.EyeTracker import EyeTracker` instead of `from ..eye_tracking.EyeTracker import EyeTracker`
2. **Disconnected Integration**: The eye tracker and browser manager were running in separate threads without proper integration

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### **1. Fixed Import Statements**

**Before** (incorrect):
```python
from eye_tracking.EyeTracker import EyeTracker
```

**After** (correct):
```python
from ..eye_tracking.EyeTracker import EyeTracker
```

This was fixed in two locations:
- `start_eye_tracker_calibration()` method
- `proceed_with_test_after_calibration()` method

### **2. Proper Eye Tracker Integration**

**Before** (disconnected):
```python
# Separate threads with no integration
def browser_thread():
    test_manager.start_test_with_browser(completion_callback=on_test_complete)

def eye_tracker_thread():
    tracker = EyeTracker()
    tracker.track(duration_sec, debug=True)  # Standalone tracking
```

**After** (integrated):
```python
# Eye tracker passed to test manager for proper integration
tracker = EyeTracker()
tracker.is_calibrated = True
test_manager = IntegratedTestManager(self.current_test_data, eye_tracker=tracker)

def browser_thread():
    test_manager.start_test_with_browser(completion_callback=on_test_complete)
```

## 🔄 **How It Works Now**

1. **Calibration Phase**: User calibrates the eye tracker
2. **Integration Setup**: Eye tracker is passed to `IntegratedTestManager`
3. **Browser Launch**: `IntegratedTestManager` starts the browser and integrates eye tracking
4. **Gaze Recording**: Browser manager calls `__gazePlay.record(x, y, "device")` every second
5. **Test Completion**: Timer calls `__gazePlay.end()` and logs results

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior**

After these fixes:
- ✅ Eye tracker calibration should work without import errors
- ✅ After calibration, the test should proceed normally
- ✅ Eye tracking data should be recorded during the browser session
- ✅ Results should be collected when the timer finishes

## 🧪 **Testing**

Run the test integration script to verify the fixes:
```bash
python test_integration_fix.py
```

This will verify that all imports work correctly and objects can be created successfully.

## 🚀 **Result**

The "test integration not available" error should be resolved, and the full eye tracking test flow should work as intended:

1. Start test → 2. Calibrate → 3. Run test with browser → 4. Record gaze data → 5. Show results
