# Auto-Navigation After Save Enhancement

## ✅ **Feature Added Successfully!**

When users save their test configuration on the setup page, they are now **automatically redirected back to the main menu**.

## 🔄 **User Experience Flow**

### Before (Manual Navigation):

1. User fills out setup form
2. User clicks "Save Test Config"
3. Success message appears
4. **User must manually click "Back to Main Menu"** ← Extra step!

### After (Auto-Navigation):

1. User fills out setup form
2. User clicks "Save Test Config"
3. Success message appears
4. **Automatically returns to main menu** ← Seamless!

## 🎯 **Implementation**

Added a single line of code in `save_test_config()` method:

```python
# After successful save and data storage
self.current_test_data = stored_data
print("✅ Test configuration saved successfully!")

# Navigate back to main menu after successful save
self.show_title_screen()  # ← New line added
```
